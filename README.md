A simple, single file player movement prototype using Box2D and Raylib, written in C++. Includes use of foot a sensor to track whether the player is on the ground.

Also includes some basic debug functions, including the ability to draw debug shapes based on b2Polygons, ability to draw center of body, and draw foot sensor status and player position. 

Movement keys are W and A to move left and right, and space to jump.
